Issue #1:
msxml4.dll error 80070005 Access denied

Solution:
You must have MSXML4 SP2 installed. Read the release notes; toward the end it explains your problem (see also below).
Note that I haven't figured out how to fix it on Win2K, but the "Resultant Set of Policy Wizard" (MMC Snapin) appears
to be the solution for XP and 2K3.

Security tightened when posting data using the ServerXmlHttp object 
Security in the implementation of the MSXML 4.0 SP2 ServerXmlHttp object has been enhanced to check the Internet Explorer
security policy setting for submitting non-encrypted form data. A security policy setting of "Disable" or "Prompt" for the
"Submit nonencrypted form data" option will result in an "Access Denied" error message when attempting to post form data
using the ServerXmlHttp object. This is a change that can potentially break existing code that uses earlier versions of the
ServerXmlHttp object (such as prior released versions of both MSXML 3.0 and MSXML 4.0) to post form data when the
Internet Explorer security policy setting for submitting non-encrypted form data is not enabled.
